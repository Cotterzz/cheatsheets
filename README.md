# cheatsheets
A set of cheatsheets, each in the file format that is the cheatsheet's subject, for convenient copy-pasting.

I'm going to start with CSS, as that's the one I need most right now, but HTML and Javascript seem to be logical additions.

cheatsheets to add:

1. Web audio API
2. Three.js
3. WebGL
4. SVG
5. Webassembly
